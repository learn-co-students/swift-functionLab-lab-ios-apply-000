/*: question1
 ### 1. Write a function called `helloWorld()` that prints "Hello, world!" to the console. Then call it to see your string printed to the playground console.
 */
// write your code here
func helloWorld(){
    
    print ("Hello World")
}
helloWorld()



/*: question2
 ### 2. Write your own function in which you declare a constant inside the function's body and then print that constant to the console. Call this function to see your string printed to the playground console.
 */
// write your code here
func myFunction(name: String){
    print ("This function belongs to \(name)")
}

myFunction(name: "Robert Ciaccio")

/*: question3
 ### 3. Write a function that takes a person's name as an argument and prints a greeting to the console. Call it several times with different arguments. What do you think you'll see in the console?
 */
// write your code here
func userName(name: String) -> String{
    let response = ("Hello \(name), welcome to this function")
    return response
}

let firstUser = userName(name: "Rob")
let secondUser = userName(name: "Michelle")
let thirdUser = userName (name: "Jamie")

print (firstUser)
print (secondUser)
print (thirdUser)


/*: question4
 ### 4. Now call the function you wrote in Question 3 using a variable or constant instead of a string literal. What do you expect to see in the console? Try passing in a _variable_ you declared (using `var`) as an argument. Then change that variable's value and call your function again. What do you see in the console?
 */
// write your code here
var catName = "Tye"

let catUser = userName(name: (catName))
print (catUser)

catName = "Melly"
print (catUser) // The variable became a constant once it was called into the function.


/*: question5
 ### 5. Write your own function in which you declare a _variable_ (of any type) inside the function's body. Print out this variable to the console from within your function. After you print the variable once, assign a new value to this variable on the next line. Print it again (after the line on which you assign it to a new value). Call your function several times. What do you expect to see printed to the playground's console each time you call this function?
 */
// write your code here
func lastFunction(randoVariable: String) -> String{
    var lastResponse = (randoVariable)
    return lastResponse
}

var displayThis = lastFunction(randoVariable: "Dog")
print (displayThis)

displayThis = lastFunction(randoVariable: "Cat")
print (displayThis)
print (displayThis)
print (displayThis)// The most recent variable continues to print
